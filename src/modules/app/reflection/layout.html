          <h4>During my time in North Carolina State University’s Masters of Geospatial Information Science and Technology program I have grown as a GIS professional.
             I came into the program with 5 years of GIS experience, but had never had a top to bottom look at the subject as whole. The MGIST programs core courses
              provided me with a much needed look into some of the underlying concepts in GIS.</h4>

          <h4> Principles of GIS is one of the most valuable courses I’ve take so far in the program. It helped me have a deeper understanding as to what is going on
             behind the scenes in GIS by looking into graph theory and understanding spatial indexing. As a GIS web developer having a strong foundation in the core
              of how to create geospatial systems is the first step in working to improve upon those systems and help move them to new mediums. My goal as GIS professional
               is to continue the advancement of GIS on the web and create new innovative applications and libraries that increasingly bring the power of GIS to the masses. </h4>
          <h4>My master’s project Plott is my first major attempt to create a new open-source JavaScript library that contributes to this effort. While working on Plott I also
             contributed a module (<a class="skills-link" href="https://github.com/Turfjs/turf-weighted-centroid" target="_blank">turf-weighted-centroid</a>) to another open-source project called turf. Turf is a JavaScript library that provides an API to perform GIS vector
              analysis on either the client or server.  However, I feel Plott is not as good as it could have been because I was torn between creating the indoor
              positioning system and the application to do the K9 Nose Work study. If I were to redo the project, I would separate the project from the beginning
              because they are really two separate projects. With that said I am proud of Plott at this point and look forward to continuing working on it. I enjoyed
               the course as whole, but struggled with adapting Plott to specific assignments because of how different it was from the standard project. This was
                especially true when dealing with issues with my community partner because I did not reach the part of the project where Sue and I could collaborate. </h4>
          <h4>Overall, I enjoyed my experience in the MGIST program and still have 6 credits left to complete my degree.</h4>
