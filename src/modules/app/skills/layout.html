            <h4 class="skills-desc">Throughout both my educational and professional career I have mostly used Esri products in the GIS desktop setting, but also use GRASS,
               QGIS and other open source desktop tools on various projects at NCSU and at work. My first job in GIS involved digitizing all of the sidewalks in Asheville,
                NC and that quickly led to creating other large datasets from scratch for the city.</h4>

                <h4>Another dataset I created for the City of Asheville was Riverside Cemetery. The cemetery dataset included the feature classes sections, lots and graves,
                   and a raster mosaic of the cemetery from picture taken from a helium ballon.</h4>

                <h4> By creating these datasets and from classes at NC State I have developed
                 a strong understanding of how to produce quality data for large projects. These roles led me to a position where I now design programs to automate and
                  increase efficancy for these types of processes. In addition to GIS data entry I have also done various types of geospatial anaysis. One of the more interesting
                   projects I worked on at NCSU involved identifying gas pockets in sewer sanitary systems force mains using geomorphons with GRASS.</h4>

                applications that bring GIS design and development to the web. One recent example is the City of Raleigh Hydrant Inspection Dashboard.</h4>

            <h4 class="skills-desc">At the City of Raleigh I help maintain all Public Utilities feature classes, feature datasets and tables within ArcSDE. As part of this duty I write python scripts to run
              at set itervals that perform various tasks on the database. Some of these tasks include archeiving, creating and deleting versions, compressing, reidexing and analyizing
              feature datasets. While others involve populating facility ids on utilities and calculating slopes of pipes. At NCSU, I have setup Postgresql with PostGIS,
               ArcSDE and ArcGIS Server on a Windows Server. I also like to use MongoDB in cases where applications will have high write rates and need to be rapidly developed. MongoDB also has good
               geospatial abilities, but not as developed as PostGIS.</h4>
